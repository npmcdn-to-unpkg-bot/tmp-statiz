I landed in this country 6 days ago. I've traversed nearly 1,000 kilometers in that span via taxi, pickup truck, ferry, train, subway, mini-van, motorbike, and of course my legs. Just 8 days ago I was still a full-time employee at *redacted*. [^n]

It was drizzling when I deplaned at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, this came as no surprise as it pretty much rains briefly every single day in mainland SEA's wet season (typically between June - October). I had been wearing the same swag t-shirt from my previous employer for 24 hours, suffice it to say, I was not feeling fresh [^n]. The wetness definitely washed away some of the face-oils so I wasn't complaining. I've done long plane rides before. I've spent many summers visiting extended family in Taiwan so I knew that the ride would be grueling, especially if you're a little squeamish at the idea of flying 1.2 kilometers over the open Pacific.[^n].

When I was a kid, a Nintendo Gameboy would hold me over, provided that the battery lasted  the entire trip (usually didn't). This time a different problem manifested. Somewhere over Lake Erie (BOS -> DTW) the screen on the iPhone decided to stop responding to my touch. My lock button hasn't worked ever since I thought it would be a good idea to listen to music in the shower (turns out it's a bad idea). I spent 5 hours toggling the vibrate momentary as well as continuously pressing the home screen just to get the battery to drain in the hope that when it eventually restarted, it would go back to normal (it did). [^n]

I suppose now would be a good time to mention why I'm doing what I'm doing. Since I was a sophomore in college I've held a job of some form. When I graduated I was extremely lucky that tech was just blowing up and have had the grand fortune of waltzing from job to job. These positions more or less presented themselves in front of me. As much as I'd like to believe that any life successes are an acme of my natural talent, I'm skeptical of such a claim. Sometimes it seems that I'm just a passenger to the events that have unfolded around me. Additionally while I won't claim that I've lived with a silver spoon in my mouth, I've never had to go to bed hungry, and with that I owe the world to my parents.

Objectively speaking, there's pretty much only one thing I'm good at and that thing is writing software (more specifically algorithmic analysis). Over the course of my post-undergraduate career I've had the privilege of working for three world-class organizations. I joined my last position with the goal of laying the foundation for building a multiple-system operator (MSO) capable of competing with big cable, completely over IP - in industry parlance over-the-top. I accepted an interview on a whim and arrived at the office when it was just 4 people chilling in a warehouse loft in Boston's Seaport District. We've now hit the point where it's just about to go live with about 70 real employees. Similar to how a humpback whale might out of the ocean to get some air, I was able to look back at what I've done during my tenure there.  I've designed many things addressing unique problem sets that I'm proud of including FP-style libraries, ultra-low latency backbones, and other heaps of things that I can't really divulge right now; all of which I've spent many many weeks laboring over and essentially surrendered over.

Any half-decent engineer probably provides value that far exceeds their compensation, but demand has driven market compensation to ridiculous levels. Selfishly, I realize that demand for qualified techies today has never been this high. But yet I feel unsatisfied, call it a quarter-life crisis. I've spent so much time bringing the ideas of other people to fruition; it's just so much easier to hit pause and walk away (for now). Walk away from a perfectly good job? Why not?

My time in Southeast Asia is relatively short, compared to most of the backpackers here on the Banana Pancake Trail. I'm spending a grand total of 23 days in Thailand (considering sneaking into Burma for a couple hours but responsible me isn't sure how I'll adapt to a Burmese jail.) [^n] After this I'm spending a couple days back in New England then moving down to NYC where I'll be joining *The Recurse Center* until the end of the year.

For the uninitiated, the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com) is the self-purported "best programming community in the world". The reason behind this is because I feel that I need to broaden my horizons (not to sound cliche) and re-strategize the trajectory that I'm going while I can still afford to do so. This is something that I feel like I have to do now, otherwise I'll always regret not doing it. Everything else (that house, car, jetski) can wait. After RC I'm keeping my options wide open : )

Back to when I landed in Bangkok... I had done some very tentative planning before I left. I put together a laundry list of days in the geographical regions that I wanted to cover:

- 3 x Siem Reap/Angkor War
- 4 x Bangkok
- 4 x Southern Kohs
- 5 x Chiang Mai
- 6 x Days spare (maybe Laos?)

It didn't take very long for this list to get axed. I cleared customs at the airport around 11:20 PM. Bangkok public transport shuts down at midnight, which in my opinion is straight up unacceptable for a major metropolitan area of over 14 million people. To be fair though cabs and [tuk-tuks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw) are extremely cheap, to the point that a 15-minute cab ride priced a couple shades under 6 USD is labeled a scam. It was around 11:45PM when I read the confirmation e-mail and realized that I wouldn't make it to the hostel that I had booked in Sukhumvit before the reception closed (also midnight).

I was slightly perturbed but somehow in my jet-lagged haze I managed to make it to Khao San Road, commonly regarded as the epicenter for backpacking in SEA. As it turns out, it's stupid easy to just show up at any place of accommodation and ask for a room. Ever since I've been deciding where to go next ad-hoc, sometimes mere minutes before leaving, probably not going to go to Cambodia/Laos. Traveling solo has it's benefits after all!

The above is Pai Canyon. The ridges can get quite narrow (and steep), if a sudden downpour happens you're screwed.

I spent less than a day in Bangkok. I woke up early the next morning, bought a razor blade and a yogurt from the 7-eleven and started heading north to Chiang Mai with a stopover in Ayutthaya. Saw some pretty cool ruins on the way but I wasn't really feeling energetic, being jet-lagged and all.

In the beginning I was bored out of my mind when I got to Chiang Mai. Seemingly every travel blogger is/has been based out of there at some point and everyone raves about how you can't spend enough time up north. But personally I felt that once you've seen a couple of temples, you've seen them all. Plus there were an inordinate number of western middle-aged men with dangerously young Thai girls. The cafe and food scene was admittedly pretty bumping though. It wasn't until I headed even further north that I came into my groove.

It turns out that the best way to experience the north is to rent a motorbike. There's just something about driving in the mountains, through flash downpours while ignoring road signs you can't understand. If there's something that looks like it might be interesting (not that you'd know) you can just go there [^n]. Seems like every other building is a guesthouse so accommodation is a breeze.

And with that I sign off half-way through my road-trip (or so I think) from Mae Hong Son. I'm not so sure where I'll end up between here and NYC but the road will always twist on. (Unless of course it ends abruptly in Burma)

[^n]: Technicality: I'm on sabbatical/leave of absence. I am not ruling out the possibility of  a return to my previous employer. Additionally I'm under a PIPA so I'm not going to mention the company name right now. As it is a sensitive time right before the go-live.
[^n]: It's important to stay fresh, thanks Jersey Shore
[^n]:  As an aside who's your favorite LOST character? Mine's Vincent.
[^n]: I also tried hard restoring it off of my laptop but it won't allow you to restore it as long as *Find My iPhone* is turned on. Couldn't exactly do that without the screen working... wtf Apple?
[^n]: I'm writing this from Mae Hong Son in northern Thailand. There is an unofficial border cross into a tiny Burmese village just north of  Ban Rak Thai, a village composed of (the descendants of) KMT soldiers who fled China's Yunnan province after being defeated by the CPC. The only way to reach the Burmese village is through Thailand, as no official road connects it to the Burmese highway and rumor is the guards usually don't really care if you cross over.
[^n]: Burritos, by the way.
[^n]: Actually there was one sign that was in English that said "Asia's longest cave system" that I tried going to, but the well-paved road abruptly turned to gravel. Decided not to risk getting a road tattoo. Cue the "why come you don't have a tattoo reference"
