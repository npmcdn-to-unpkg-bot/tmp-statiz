Next week I am returning to industry. It's been just under eight months since I've pulled in a steady paycheck and I'm just about ready to go back. Looking back at my break I still think it was the right decision. At the very least I've gained two life skills: how to properly use a french press (I'm a sorry excuse for a human adult) and how to ride a motorbike. I'm extremely fortunate to have been able to push the eject button. In today's world of over-sharing it's easy to get swayed by what your peers are doing - maybe they're buying houses, getting married, pursuing advanced degrees, etc. For the right people these are all awesome things, but it wasn't what I needed to do, not yet at least.

To be honest, leaving a career in pursuit of self-improvement is really not a grandiose thing to do. In fact it's probably selfish. Few people have the means or support system to eschew adult responsibilities for extended periods of time. When I left [the only home I've ever known] last summer I truthfully didn't have a concrete goal, yes I had abstract thoughts about what I wanted to do but I wouldn't have been able to describe what my endgame was. I really only had two (and a half) things to cross off my bucket list which was:

 - go backpacking in Southeast Asia
 - go to the Recurse Center in New York City

Once again I'm extremely privileged to have been able to do this. To many people once they start their first job they'll have to keep working continuously until the day that they're forced to retire. Often times people hate the situation they're in but stick it out because their alternative prospects aren't as great. The lucky ones might be able to eventually convince themselves to enjoy it especially if they are extrinsically motivated by image, status, or lifestyle.

I'll place my aards on the table: finding a good job after taking a hiatus from tech wasn't exactly a walk in the park and it wasn't as easy as I initially had thought it would be. I walked away from a lot of interviews thinking they were slam dunks only to get a **thanks for interviewing with us, but we don't want you**-type response (there have been many of these). These were frustrating slaps in the face and I don't have any insightful advice on this front. Just keep your head up and internalize the rejection - treat every time that you feel unwanted as another chip on your shoulder. For everyone who says you're not good enough, use this as a chance to prove to yourself that you are. Nobody will ever know the limits of how great you can be.

It took me longer than expected to put ink on paper for the right opportunity. Come next Monday I'll be starting in Union Square NYC leading the next generation of backend development on [Indicative's](http://indicative.com) behavioral analytics platform.
