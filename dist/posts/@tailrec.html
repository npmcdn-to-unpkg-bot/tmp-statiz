<p>Next week I am returning to industry. It&#39;s been just under eight months since I&#39;ve pulled in a steady paycheck and I&#39;m just about ready to go back. Looking back at my break I still think it was the right decision. At the very least I&#39;ve gained two life skills: how to properly use a french press (I&#39;m a sorry excuse for a human adult) and how to ride a motorbike. I&#39;m extremely fortunate to have been able to push the eject button. In today&#39;s world of over-sharing it&#39;s easy to get swayed by what your peers are doing - maybe they&#39;re buying houses, getting married, pursuing advanced degrees, etc. For the right people these are all awesome things, but it wasn&#39;t what I needed to do, not yet at least.</p>
<p>To be honest, leaving a career in pursuit of self-improvement is really not a grandiose thing to do. In fact it&#39;s probably selfish. Few people have the means or support system to eschew adult responsibilities for extended periods of time. When I left [the only home I&#39;ve ever known] last summer I truthfully didn&#39;t have a concrete goal, yes I had abstract thoughts about what I wanted to do but I wouldn&#39;t have been able to describe what my endgame was. I really only had two (and a half) things to cross off my bucket list which was:</p>
<ul>
<li>go backpacking in Southeast Asia</li>
<li>go to the Recurse Center in New York City</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again I&#39;m extremely privileged to have been able to do this. To many people once they start their first job they&#39;ll have to keep working continuously until the day that they&#39;re forced to retire. Often times people hate the situation they&#39;re in but stick it out because their alternative prospects aren&#39;t as great. The lucky ones might be able to eventually convince themselves to enjoy it especially if they are extrinsically motivated by image, status, or lifestyle.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll place my aards on the table: finding a good job after taking a hiatus from tech wasn&#39;t exactly a walk in the park and it wasn&#39;t as easy as I initially had thought it would be. I walked away from a lot of interviews thinking they were slam dunks only to get a <strong>thanks for interviewing with us, but we don&#39;t want you</strong>-type response (there have been many of these). These were frustrating slaps in the face and I don&#39;t have any insightful advice on this front. Just keep your head up and internalize the rejection - treat every time that you feel unwanted as another chip on your shoulder. For everyone who says you&#39;re not good enough, use this as a chance to prove to yourself that you are. Nobody will ever know the limits of how great you can be.</p>
<p>It took me longer than expected to put ink on paper for the right opportunity. Come next Monday I&#39;ll be starting in Union Square NYC leading the next generation of backend development on <a href="http://indicative.com">Indicative&#39;s</a> behavioral analytics platform.</p>
