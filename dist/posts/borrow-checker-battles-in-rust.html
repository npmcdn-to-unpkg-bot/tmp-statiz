<p>Likely the first thing that baby rustaceans will bang their heads on is the concept of lifetimes and the borrow checker. One of the things I took for granted in virtually every other programming language that I used was the ability to call methods off of an object without too much fuss. Calling methods needs to be handled drastically differently in rust-lang.</p>
<p>In the listing below I&#39;m trying to model a simple type representing a node in a simple neural network:</p>
<ul>
<li>An instance of a Neuron will contain a 32 bit integer for the number of inputs it takes <em>num_inputs</em></li>
<li>It will also contain a vector of weights (as 64-bit floating points) that dictate the value of those inputs <em>weights</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The corresponding struct probably looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct Neuron {
  num_inputs: i32,
  weights: Vec&lt;f64&gt;
}
</code></pre><p>We&#39;ll also want to create the rust analogue to a static method <em>(Neuron::new)</em> which serves as a constructor by randomly generating a total of <em>ninputs</em> floating points to populate a Neuron struct accordingly. <em>Note that in the listing we&#39;re actually creating ninputs+1</em></p>
<pre><code>impl Neuron {
  fn new (ninputs: i32) -&gt; Neuron {
    let mut weight_vec = Vec::new();
    // add {ninputs+1} weights...
    for _ in 0..(ninputs+1) {
      weight_vec.push(rand::random::&lt;f64&gt;());
    }
    Neuron{num_inputs: ninputs, weights: weight_vec}
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Now let&#39;s say we want to do some quality logging at some point and we would like to print out each of the weights in a neuron&#39;s vector. For convenience let&#39;s make it a method! Hmm yeah...! let&#39;s add it to <code>impl Neuron</code> shall we?</p>
<pre><code>impl Neuron {

      /* ... blah blah... fn new still looks the same */

          fn print_weights (self) {
                    for weight in self.weights {
                                  println!(&quot;{}&quot;, weight);
                                          }
                                              }
}
</code></pre><p>Now we can instantiate an instance, and then print the weights like so:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
      let a_neuron = Neuron::new(2);
          a_neuron.print_weights();
}
</code></pre><p>With any luck we&#39;d probably see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>0.7330616595228169
0.6183962989161881
0.79081893581957
</code></pre><p>But what if we wanted to print it again?</p>
<pre><code>let a_neuron = Neuron::new(2);
a_neuron.print_weights();
a_neuron.print_weights();
</code></pre><p>This is where everything falls apart and you start to turn to StackOverflow (by way of google of course). You&#39;ll most likely see a compiler error along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>use of moved value `a_neuron`
</code></pre><p>So what&#39;s going on here? If we take a look at the signature for <code>Neuron::print_weights</code>:</p>
<pre><code>fn print_weights (self)
</code></pre><p>It turns out that because of the<code>self</code> parameter, when the method is called  <code>a_neuron.print_weights</code> implicitly takes ownership of <code>self</code> (these are move semantics). When <code>a_neuron.print_weights</code> is called the second time, ownership is never yielded back to the main function (or whatever function we calling it from).</p>
<p>In order to make this work, we need to <strong>declare print_weights as a borrow, as well as the access to self.weights</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>fn print_weights (&amp;self) {
  for weight in &amp;self.weights {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, weight);
  }
 }
</code></pre><p>Our full listing ends up looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate rand;

struct Neuron {
  num_inputs: i32,
  weights: Vec&lt;f64&gt;
}

impl Neuron {
  fn new (ninputs: i32) -&gt; Neuron {
    let mut weight_vec = Vec::new();
    //add {ninputs + 1} weights
    for _ in 0..(ninputs+1) {
      weight_vec.push(rand::random::&lt;f64&gt;());
    }
    Neuron{num_inputs: ninputs, weights: weight_vec}
  }

  fn print_weights (&amp;self) {
    for weight in &amp;self.weights {
      println!(&quot;{}&quot;, weight);
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let a_neuron = Neuron::new(2);
  a_neuron.print_weights();
}
</code></pre><p>And hopefully we see output along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>0.45597887767522716
0.6523807976419703
0.43939320025023854
