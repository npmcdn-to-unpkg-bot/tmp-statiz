<p>It&#39;s been an incredible journey over the last month. Somewhere over either Vietnam or the South China Sea I was ambushed with the irony of flying halfway around the world just to move again a few days later. I couldn&#39;t, and still can&#39;t believe that this is finally happening.</p>
<p>The sweltering heat is only one of the things you leave behind when traveling roughly 14,000 kilometers from Bangkok to Boston. After a couple days you learn to appreciate any air-conditioned havens you discover. Gone too is the maddening traffic, inhale-able pollution, and 3AM roadside $1 noodles with intense (and loud) philosophical debates sprinkled in (seriously though, why isn&#39;t this a thing in the states?)</p>

<p>My bleary eyes were a little on the watery side that morning, I had to catch a 4AM taxi after all. I tried fitting a lot into the 3.5 weeks I was on the road, since I had left the conventional 9-5. I have no regrets about getting this show on the road and seeing where it leads in the coming months. I&#39;ve learned over the last few years that it takes a much longer time for me to open up to people, even people that I&#39;ve known for many moons. This will always be something that I need to work on and is one of the things that I&#39;ve tried to break free of while traveling far away from home.</p>

<sub> &gt; Bangkok on a <em>clear</em> day</p>
<p>I&#39;ve met so many people and new friends whether it be other weary travelers, locals, expats just over the last month (more than the combined last 4 years of my life) and as clich√© as it sounds I&#39;m so happy that I was able to spend time and experience new things together. It&#39;s unfortunate I had to go home so early and say goodbye to so many new friends.</p>

<p>Those of you who know me may know that I let my introverted side show sometimes. I'm aware of all these modern day resources that try to typeset us into certain types, but this isn't something that I necessarily subscribe to. One guy I met on a bus to a ferry to get down to Koh Pha Ngan was particularly interested in the human psyche and was convinced that I was inherently extroverted based on the fact that we were talking the entire extent of the bus ride. It&#39;s important to remember that one thing we have control over is we try to present ourselves to others. I think that all of humans have our own wants and desires. Everyone moves at their own pace. And everything is probably going to end up fine.</p>
<p>The decision to flee Boston was borderline desperate as a grandiose and maybe even gonzo plan of stepping into the nether. I still don&#39;t know how the next few months will end up turning out but if there&#39;s only one takeaway that I&#39;ll bring back to the states it&#39;s that I&#39;ll figure out a way to survive. I&#39;m not worried about what comes next, but I sure am looking forward to it.</p>

<sub> &gt; Chalok Lam, northernmost fishing village on Koh Pha Ngan. I hiked up here 3.5 miles with my 40L along the shore and through rolling hills in the hopes that a taxi boat would take me to a secluded beach unreachable by conventional road vehicles. The taxis only leave if the boats full - otherwise they rip you off for 200baht (it&#39;s the principle that gets to me, not the dollar amount) had to hike back down. The sand here was the best I found on the island though.</p>
<p>Getting to some of the remote parts of the region, off the beaten path, was one of the (many) highlights. Bangkok&#39;s a great city - one of my absolute favorites out of all of the ones I&#39;ve passed through in my years of traveling. There&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s a cosmopolitan gem. It&#39;s one of those cities that you namedrop anywhere in the world, and people know about it; this is akin to first name athletes like Lebron, Peyton, Pedro, etc. you don&#39;t. Once you get off the beaten path however, all bets are off you don&#39;t have to stick to the traditional guidebooks (well, mostly because lack of information). There&#39;s also a lot less expectations and more freedom to pace yourself to say the least.</p>

<sub> &gt; I found myself standing in the middle of an alpaca farm / botanical garden in Mae Hong Son province when I was looking for the Thai-Burmese border. (you sort of head north until the road stops being road and yeah, I know they&#39;re just sheep - alpaca sounds more exotic)</p>
<p>Similarly, Cambodia, though a hugely popular destination almost entirely because of Angkor, is another huge culture shock (but Thailand eases you into it). I wasn&#39;t even planning on making it to Cambodia halfway through but I decided to buy tickets on a night train from Surat Thani to Bangkok off of a tethered iPhone connection because I wasn&#39;t sure the next time that I&#39;d be in the area.</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s firmly ingrained into Khmer culture to politely badger people - you always have to keep smiling though. It's an interesting game coming up with new ways to say know while maintaining a smile. It&#39;s also nicknamed <em>Scambodia</em> for a reason. Tourist vs local prices, variations on the gem scam, creative stretching of the begging concept abound, and tipping immigration agents at the border (seriously this is considered normal practice - you just start handing over small bills until they guy starts smiling). I encountered no less than 3 school-kids lurking in a 200 meter swath of jungles around the temples of Siem Reap looking for a little money here and there. It&#39;s a well rehearsed dialogue.</p>

<li>They&#39;ll ask you where you&#39;re from.</li>
<li>&quot;Oh, USA? Capital: Washington DC, President: Barack Obama, Population: 300 million&quot;</li>
<li>Then they&#39;ll ask you for a donation for their school on a pledge form filled with a bunch of generic names &quot;Tim Smith&quot; - $1000, etc.</li>
</ol>

<sub> &gt; The road from Thong Sala to Haad Yao</p>
<p>The infrastructure there can&#39;t keep up with the number of tourists passing through (and sometimes it seems on purpose). The hostel that we stayed at lost power no less than 4 times, though some of that was due to the construction crew (more like a mob) that was inexplicably digging up the side of the road only to fill it up again with more dirt. They completely sawed through a power line, which happens a lot evidently. There&#39;s nothing to complain about though (not like I was carrying bricks of ice around in my gear) get 50 cent beer in the candlelit hostel bar was probably just as fun as getting it in conventional lighting. I&#39;ve only been in a powerless bar once before (it was during a power outage in Boston - Yeah I don&#39;t get out much).</p>

<sub> &gt; Get ready for touts. Just smile and shake your head.</p>
<p>Despite how pestering they can be, my interactions with the Khmer were some of the most interesting memories of my trip. A good deal of them are trying to get something out of you but they're also trying to be your best friend. After a rainstorm almost seems like small Khmer children will spawn out of the walls of popular temples to swarm and try to sell you cheap plastic raincoats. Now, I&#39;ve never had dreams of fighting packs of midgets, but I suppose if you have that fantasy this would be the place to go (not that I condone violence to kids/anyone). Those girls in the covered markets <em>pleading</em> for you to buy magnets and t-shirts, those tuk-tuk lined streets where every driver asks &quot;hey man where you going?&quot; or &quot;you want tuk-tuk?&quot; just so they can drive you to their buddy's overpriced tourist restaurant. These are all real people, and humans are beautiful.</p>

<sub> &gt; Just waiting for afternoon storm clouds to roll in @ Angkor Wat</p>
<p>Originally I had intended to visit Angkor on a bike, at my own pace. When I stepped out of the airport in Siem Reap I hired a motorcycle taxi to bring me into town (quite an experience). Along the way, Rith, my Khmer driver (more like biker) who spoke excellent English explained that he&#39;s actually a farmer from several hours outside of Siem Reap and that due to heavy flooding he was working as a driver to support his family of 10. He told me he wanted to be my driver. Look, I&#39;m well aware that people in desperate situations will say whatever they need to say, and stories like these can be tailor-made. The fact of the matter is that they&#39;re not looking to scam you out of your life savings. I&#39;d already spent nearly a thousand USD to get to there on the flight alone - another few dollars will mean a whole lot more to locals than it will for me. And after that, if you end up hiring your driver - they&#39;ll be your best friend for the rest of the day (yeah, just realized I pretty much just described how to buy friends).</p>

<sub> &gt; Checkpoint on the border of Thailand and Burma, on the outskirts of Ban Raak Thai (Mae Aw). Doesn&#39;t seem like they issue visas here. You could pretty much walk across (or climb over the mountains if particularly adventurous). I didn&#39;t feel like getting arrested that day.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have a point that I&#39;m getting to but thanks so much for reading. The memories are too many to list (and most of what happens in Bangkok needs to stay in Bangkok anyways). I&#39;ll always remember Ting Tong and how he drove us around at least 6 times all the while with <em>too</em> many people crammed into the back seat passing around an awful bottle of Thai whiskey. Not sure if I can ever look at birthday cards in the same way though ;)</p>
<p>Bring it on New York, I&#39;m ready. I&#39;ve had pizza on the other side of the world - let&#39;s see what the fuss is about.</p>
<p>To friends new and old, sayonara, sawadee, I guess I&#39;ll see you around.</p>
